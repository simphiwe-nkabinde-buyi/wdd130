    <h2>Simphiwe Nkabinde</h2>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in a Bachelors of Applied Technology online degreee program through BYU-I. I intend to build a career as a web developer. I enjoy playing the piano, going out with friends and attending church meetings. I also love working out and staying fit. I am currently involved in an IT internship program full-time in Johannesburg.</p>
    <p>Something that I love about BYU-Idaho is how Gospel principles are incorporated into the learning path of students. From this course I hope to improve my understanding and skills in web design and development.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for about 13 years. One of my favourite scriptures is from the Book of Mormon in 3rd Nephi 11. It's the account of Jesus Christ visiting and ministering to the Nephites in the Ancient Americas. I am inspired by how Jesus' love for those Nephites is portrayed in the account. </p>
