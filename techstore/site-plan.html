        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            Think about the last time you were shopping around for a gadget?
            If you’re a tech enthusiast like me you probably went through a few online
            resources trying to ensure that this product had the specifications you were looking for.
            Even if you’re not much of a tech enthusiast, wouldn’t it be great if you didn’t have to go
            through the trouble of looking for credible sources for product reviews and reports?</p>

        <p>I’m a tech enthusiast who’s bought, used and recommended a variety of gadgets.
            I’ve learned how to find and where to go for credible information on electronic products.
            My goal is to create an electronics e-commerce website where customers are provided with sources
            for credible product reports and reviews. Along with each product listed on the site,
            customers will find a list of credible resources where they can learn more about the product.
            These will include detailed product review reports and videos.</p>


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Everyday consumers and technology enthusiasts looking to buy electronic products. They also want 
            comprehensive information about the products they are looking to purchase. They want to know what to 
            expect from the product they will purchase in terms of quality, functionality, and value. They will access the
            website from their mobile phones and laptops.</p>
